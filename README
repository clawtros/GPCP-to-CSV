GPCP to CSV Convertor
---------------------

Converts GPCP files (like the ones found at http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/gpcp/gpcp-v2.1/psg/) to CSV files.
If you have Sphinx installed run make and the complete html
documentation will be generated.

User comment: This is a fantastic script, which functions well. However, it presents raw precipitation data only, with no headers. The data is global precipitation data presented a gridded format, so I needed to know what location the precipitation data was for. From a  readme at the site clawtros notes above, I found this: 

First point center = (88.75°N,1.25°E)
Second point center = (88.75°N,3.75°E)
Last point center = (88.75°S,1.25°W)

From the readme text, I deduced that the file is sorted into a grid separated 2.5 degrees as follows: 
Lat 1.75 to 178.75, then -178.75 to -1.25
Lon 88.75 to 1.25, then -1.25 to -88.75

The lat is consistent for the first row of data, the lon changes. 

The first header row looks like this: 

88.75,1.25	88.75,3.75	88.75,6.25	88.75,8.75	88.75,11.25	88.75,13.75	88.75,16.25	88.75,18.75	88.75,21.25	88.75,23.75	88.75,26.25	88.75,28.75	88.75,31.25	88.75,33.75	88.75,36.25	88.75,38.75	88.75,41.25	88.75,43.75	88.75,46.25	88.75,48.75	88.75,51.25	88.75,53.75	88.75,56.25	88.75,58.75	88.75,61.25	88.75,63.75	88.75,66.25	88.75,68.75	88.75,71.25	88.75,73.75	88.75,76.25	88.75,78.75	88.75,81.25	88.75,83.75	88.75,86.25	88.75,88.75	88.75,91.25	88.75,93.75	88.75,96.25	88.75,98.75	88.75,101.25	88.75,103.75	88.75,106.25	88.75,108.75	88.75,111.25	88.75,113.75	88.75,116.25	88.75,118.75	88.75,121.25	88.75,123.75	88.75,126.25	88.75,128.75	88.75,131.25	88.75,133.75	88.75,136.25	88.75,138.75	88.75,141.25	88.75,143.75	88.75,146.25	88.75,148.75	88.75,151.25	88.75,153.75	88.75,156.25	88.75,158.75	88.75,161.25	88.75,163.75	88.75,166.25	88.75,168.75	88.75,171.25	88.75,173.75	88.75,176.25	88.75,178.75	88.75,-178.75	88.75,-176.25	88.75,-173.75	88.75,-171.25	88.75,-168.75	88.75,-166.25	88.75,-163.75	88.75,-161.25	88.75,-158.75	88.75,-156.25	88.75,-153.75	88.75,-151.25	88.75,-148.75	88.75,-146.25	88.75,-143.75	88.75,-141.25	88.75,-138.75	88.75,-136.25	88.75,-133.75	88.75,-131.25	88.75,-128.75	88.75,-126.25	88.75,-123.75	88.75,-121.25	88.75,-118.75	88.75,-116.25	88.75,-113.75	88.75,-111.25	88.75,-108.75	88.75,-106.25	88.75,-103.75	88.75,-101.25	88.75,-98.75	88.75,-96.25	88.75,-93.75	88.75,-91.25	88.75,-88.75	88.75,-86.25	88.75,-83.75	88.75,-81.25	88.75,-78.75	88.75,-76.25	88.75,-73.75	88.75,-71.25	88.75,-68.75	88.75,-66.25	88.75,-63.75	88.75,-61.25	88.75,-58.75	88.75,-56.25	88.75,-53.75	88.75,-51.25	88.75,-48.75	88.75,-46.25	88.75,-43.75	88.75,-41.25	88.75,-38.75	88.75,-36.25	88.75,-33.75	88.75,-31.25	88.75,-28.75	88.75,-26.25	88.75,-23.75	88.75,-21.25	88.75,-18.75	88.75,-16.25	88.75,-13.75	88.75,-11.25	88.75,-8.75	88.75,-6.25	88.75,-3.75	88.75,-1.25

The second row starts:

86.25,1.25	86.25,3.75	86.25,6.25	86.25,8.75	86.25,11.25	86.25,13.75	86.25,16.25	86.25,18.75

From that information you should be able to build the headers.
